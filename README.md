# Description 
This project is a comprehensive web application built using the ASP.NET framework and SQLite database, designed to handle a full item management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and an integrated checkout process. Key features include a robust membership system, enabling users to create accounts, view their order history, and manage their profiles. The project also incorporates PayPal as a secure payment solution, along with Google reCAPTCHA to prevent bot signups and spam.

In terms of security, the application includes account deactivation and reactivation functionality, as well as the ability to set and answer security questions to safeguard user accounts. Additionally, passwords are hashed for added data protection. Error handling features ensure smooth user experiences, such as field validation, restrictions on login attempts, and adherence to specific formats for registration inputs.
